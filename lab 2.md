#### TASK 6: Setting lifecycle Policies
**In this task, you'll set a  lifecycle policy to automatically move older versions of objcets in your source bucket to S3 standard-infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA). The policy should also eventuallyexpires the objects.**
- Configure two rules in the website bucket's lifecycle configuration. To receive full-credit, create two seperate rules. Don not configure two transitions in a single rule: this will need to be deleted
